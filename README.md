Election_Analysis
OVERVIEW OF ELECTION AUDIT
I was tasked with helping Tom, Colorado board of elections employee, in this project to report the total number of casted votes, amount of votes per candidate, percentage of the votes for each candidate, and present the winner of the election based on highest vote count. The 3 primary voting methods that Tom and I have to consider are mail-in ballots, direct recording electric counting machines, and punch cards. This will help to determine the fianl election results. I am tasked with using Python to write algorithms that will assist the confirmation and analysis. In order for my analaysis to be successful, I have to calculate the total number of votes, number of candidates in the race, number of votes received by each candidate along with the percentage, and determine the winner with the percentage.

Summary
This was a great experience to be able to create a Python script to be used in an election analysis. This script may be used in other elections also. By using this script it was able to be determined which candidate won and also provided a lot of other important numbers and percentages. This allowed a thorough analysis by looking at each county also. There could be changes made to the script where you could analyze new laws that may be implemented to understand the percentages behind the choices. This would likely just require changes in the wording of the script like changing the candidate to law or whatever we want to consider. This information could also be analyzed at the local level or the state level and this again would only require a change in the script.
