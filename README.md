Election_Analysis
OVERVIEW OF ELECTION AUDIT
I was tasked with helping Tom, Colorado board of elections employee, in this project to report the total number of casted votes, amount of votes per candidate, percentage of the votes for each candidate, and present the winner of the election based on highest vote count. The 3 primary voting methods that Tom and I have to consider are mail-in ballots, direct recording electric counting machines, and punch cards. This will help to determine the fianl election results. I am tasked with using Python to write algorithms that will assist the confirmation and analysis. In order for my analaysis to be successful, I have to calculate the total number of votes, number of candidates in the race, number of votes received by each candidate along with the percentage, and determine the winner with the percentage.
